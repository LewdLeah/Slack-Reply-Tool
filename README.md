# Slack Reply Tool ⮎
Made by LewdLeah ❤️

---

## Why?

Slack threads are a mess without a built-in reply feature like Discord has.

---

## How It Works

| Step | What You Do | What Happens |
|:----:|:------------|:-------------|
| 1 | Copy a Slack message link | Tool remembers it (for up to 60 seconds) |
| 2 | Copy the text you want to quote | Tool gets ready~ |
| 3 | Ctrl+V anywhere in Slack | Pastes a sexy formatted quote with reply link |

**Output looks like:**
```
> *[⮎ Reply](https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/...)*
> Whatever text you quoted

Your actual reply goes here
```

## Steps to Install

1. **Download AutoHotkey v2** → [autohotkey.com/download](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)
   - It's a free Windows automation tool, don't worry it's not a virus lmao
2. **Run the installer** → Just click Next until it's done
3. **Download this script** → Click the green `Code` button above → `Download ZIP`
4. **Extract the ZIP** → Right-click → Extract All
5. **Double-click `SlackReplyTool.ahk`** → You'll see a green **H** icon in your system tray

<sub>Want it to run automatically? Put a shortcut to the .ahk file in your Startup folder (`Win+R` → `shell:startup`)</sub>

## Steps to Use

1. **Right-click a Slack message** → Copy link
   - You'll see a tooltip: `⮎ Link copied`
2. **Select & copy the text** you want to quote (from that message or anywhere)
   - You'll see a tooltip: `⮎ Quote ready`
3. **Ctrl+V** to paste your formatted reply
4. Type your actual reply and hit Enter

That's literally it. The link expires after 60 seconds so you don't accidentally quote something from 3 hours ago.

## Permission

Free and open-source! Use it, share it, modify it, whatever. Just be nice to each other in those threads~
